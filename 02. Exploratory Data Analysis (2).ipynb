Several carmakers and technology companies have concluded that making autonomous vehicles is going to be harder, slower and costlier than they thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Ford\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s chief executive, Jim Hackett, said at the Detroit Economic Club in April.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the most recent sign of the scramble to regroup, Ford and Volkswagen said Friday that they were teaming up to tackle the self-driving challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two automakers plan to use autonomous-vehicle technology from a Pittsburgh start-up, Argo AI, in ride-sharing services in a few urban zones as early as 2021. But Argo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s chief executive, Bryan Salesky, said the industry\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s bigger promise of creating driverless cars that could go anywhere was \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153way in the future.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe and others attribute the delay to something as obvious as it is stubborn: human behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers at Argo say the cars they are testing in Pittsburgh and Miami have to navigate unexpected situations every day. Recently, one of the company\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s cars encountered a bicyclist riding the wrong way down a busy street between other vehicles. Another Argo test car came across a street sweeper that suddenly turned a giant circle in an intersection, touching all four corners and crossing lanes of traffic that had the green light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153You see all kinds of crazy things on the road, and it turns out they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re not all that infrequent, but you have to be able to handle all of them,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Mr. Salesky said. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153With radar and high-resolution cameras and all the computing power we have, we can detect and identify the objects on a street. The hard part is anticipating what they\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re going to do next.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Salesky said Argo and many competitors had developed about 80 percent of the technology needed to put self-driving cars into routine use \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d the radar, cameras and other sensors that can identify objects far down roads and highways. But the remaining 20 percent, including developing software that can reliably anticipate what other drivers, pedestrians and cyclists are going to do, will be much more difficult, he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year ago, many industry executives exuded much greater certainty. They thought that their engineers had solved the most vexing technical problems and promised that self-driving cars would be shuttling people around town in at least several cities by sometime this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaymo, which is owned by Google\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s parent company, Alphabet, announced that it would buy up to 62,000 Chrysler minivans and 20,000 Jaguar electric cars for its ride service, which operates in the Phoenix suburbs. General Motors announced that it would also start a taxi service by the end of this year with vehicles, developed by its Cruise division, that have no steering wheels or pedals.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptivated by the notion of disrupting the transportation system, deep-pocketed investors rushed to get a piece of the action. Honda and the Japanese tech giant SoftBank invested in Cruise. Amazon, which hopes to deliver goods to its shoppers by driverless vehicles, invested in Aurora, another start-up in this area.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153There was this incredible optimism,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Navigant Research. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Companies thought this was a very straightforward problem. You just throw in some sensors and artificial intelligence, and it would be easy to do.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009dnd artificial intelligence, and it would be easy to do.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe industry\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s unbridled confidence was quickly dented when a self-driving car being tested by Uber hit and killed a woman walking a bicycle across a street last year in Tempe, Ariz. A safety driver was at the wheel of the vehicle, but was watching a TV show on her phone just before the crash, according to the Tempe Police Department.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince that fatality, \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153almost everybody has reset their expectations,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Mr. Abuelsamid said. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death involving a self-driving vehicle. Elsewhere in the United States, three Tesla drivers have died in crashes that occurred while the company\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Autopilot driver-assistance system was engaged and both it and the drivers failed to detect and react to hazards.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies like Waymo and G.M. now say they still expect to roll out thousands of self-driving cars \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d but they are much more reluctant to say when that will happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaymo operates a fleet of 600 test vehicles \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d the same number it had on the road a year ago. A portion of them are the first set of vehicles it will be buying through the agreements with Chrysler and Jaguar. The company said it expected to increase purchases as it expanded its ride service.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153We are able to do the driving task,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Tekedra Mawakana, Waymo\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s chief external officer, said in an interview. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153But the reason we don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t have a service in 50 states is that we are still validating a host of elements related to offering a service. Offering a service is very different than building a technology.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\n\\r\\nG.M. declined to say if it was still on track to start a ride service \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153at scale\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d this year, as it originally planned. Its chief executive, Mary Barra, told analysts in June that Cruise was moving \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153at a very aggressive pace\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d without saying when commercial operations would begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina, which has the world\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s largest auto market and is investing heavily in electric vehicles, is trailing in development of self-driving cars, analysts say. The country allows automakers to test such cars on public roads in only a handful of cities. One leading Chinese company working on autonomous technology, Baidu, is doing much of its research at a lab in Silicon Valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, are nearly alone in predicting widespread use of self-driving cars within the next year. In April, Mr. Musk said Tesla would have as many as a million autonomous \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153robo taxis\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d by the end of 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla believes its new self-driving system, based on a computer chip it designed, and the data it gathers from Tesla cars now on the road will enable the company to start offering fully autonomous driving next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut many experts are very skeptical that Tesla can pull that off.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Salesky said it was relatively easy to enable a car to see and identify obstacles on the road with the help of radar, cameras and lidar \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d a kind of radar that uses lasers \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d as well as the software and computing power to process images and data.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s much more difficult to prepare self-driving cars for unusual circumstances \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201d pedestrians crossing the road when cars have the green light, cars making illegal turns. Researchers call these \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153corner cases,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d although in city traffic they occur often.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153If you\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122re out driving 20 hours a day, you have a lot of opportunities to see these things,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d Mr. Salesky said.\\r\\n\\r\\nEqually challenging is teaching self-driving cars the finer points of driving, sometimes known as \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153micro maneuvers.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d If a vehicle ahead is moving slowly looking for a parking space, it is best to not follow too closely so the car has room to back into an open spot. Or to know that if a car is edging out into an intersection, it can be a sign the driver may dart out even if he doesn\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t have the right of way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe technology is available now to create a car that won\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t hit anything. But such a car would constantly slam on the brakes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153If the car is overly cautious, this becomes a nuisance,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d said Huei Peng, director of Mcity, an autonomous-vehicle research center at the University of Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome companies argue that the way to get more self-driving vehicles on the road is by using them in controlled settings and situations. May Mobility operates autonomous shuttles in Detroit; Providence, R.I.; and Columbus, Ohio. These are not minivans or full-size cars but six-passenger golf carts. They travel short, defined routes at no more than 25 miles per hour. In many cases they provide public transportation where none is available.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153A vehicle that needs to go at higher speeds will need more expensive, more exotic sensors,\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d said Alisyn Malek, the company\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s chief operating officer. \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153Using a low-speed vehicle makes the task of operating an autonomous vehicle easier, so we can use what works in the technology today.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\", \"Category\": \"Baleno\", \"Complete_Filename\": \"Neha_Assign_AutonomusCar.txt-Baleno\"}, {\"File_Name\": \"Neha_Assign_AutonomusCar2.txt\", \"Content\": \"Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in a wide variety of products and services, including maps embedded on our smart phones and \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153chat bots\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d that help answer our questions on websites. Many hope that AI will transform our economy in ways that drive growth, similar to how steam engines did in the late 19th century and electricity did in the early 20th century. But it is hard to imagine that maps on smart phones, chatbots, and other existing AI-enabled services will drive the type of economic growth we saw from stream and electricity. What we need to see are some dramatic new AI-enabled products and services that transform our way of life\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201din short, we are waiting for an AI \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153killer app.\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d\\r\\nAutonomous vehicles (AVs)\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dvehicles that accelerate, brake, and turn on their own, requiring little or no input from a human driver\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dmay be such a killer app that transforms our economy significantly. AI supports AVs in a variety of ways, including quickly processing and interpreting the large amounts of data generated by the vehicle\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s cameras and sensors and helping to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and safety. The impacts of broad adoption of AVs are equally numerous, from potentially lowering transportation costs by limiting the need for drivers to possibly transforming mobility in urban and suburban environments. While the relative timing and scale of economic growth is not yet clear\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dand subject to some debate among scholars\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201da key step in maximizing the benefits of AVs is passing federal legislation, rather than relying on a patchwork of state and local guidelines. To inform the debate and help prepare policymakers for the task at hand, this report will examine the state of AVs, the potential for them to become a \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153killer app\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d with broad impacts, and the existing and potential regulations that could ensure net positive effects on the economy and society as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CURRENT STATE AND FUTURE OF AVS\\r\\nThe current standards for autonomous driving were developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International). According to the SAE standard, the automation capability of vehicles ranges from Level 0, with no autonomy, to Level 5, which is full automation. Level 1 features include park assist, lane assist and adaptive cruise control. Some Level 3 vehicles, which include full self-driving capabilities but require human intervention in complex situations such as traffic jams, may be commercially available in 2021. No Level 4 or 5 cars, which would not require any human intervention, are yet certified for use on regular roads, though there are some such as Google\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Waymo that are in development.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the potential impacts of AVs are substantial, it will take time for them to be realized; AVs are still some years from being commercially available, let alone in widespread use. To give a reasonable sense of timing, Chris Urmson\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201da DARPA challenge winner, head of Google\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s Waymo autonomous vehicle unit for many years, and now CEO of a self-driving vehicle software company named Aurora \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dargues it may take up to 30 to 50 years before widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Despite predictions to the contrary\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201de.g., Elon Musk\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s 2019 prediction that there would be a Tesla driverless taxi fleet in some regions by 2020\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u201dtime frames of this magnitude are common in the automobile industry. Choe, Oettl and Seamans (2021) report that widespread adoption of new innovations in the automobile sector historically can take several decades.[1] There are a number of factors that contribute to technology adoption, and even if a new technology is feasible, it may not be available at a price point that many consumers will pay. For example, turbo-charged engines, which help to reduce the amount of fuel needed, did not start to become popular until oil prices started to rise in the 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, the timing of adoption of AVs and the economic impacts that will follow depend on many factors. For regulators and policymakers interested in shaping what will likely be considerable economic and societal impacts of AVs, now is the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupporters of autonomous vehicles argue that they may provide a variety of benefits including fuel efficiency and safety. Indeed, the Brookings Institution recently published a book on the topic (Winston and Karpilow, 2020).[2] The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) argues that AVs are more fuel efficient than human-driven cars, which means fewer emissions. However, AVs may increase vehicle traffic, potentially nullifying emissions reduction from fuel efficiency. Kroger, Kuhnimhof, and Trommer (2019) project the adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies may increase vehicle traffic by 2-9 percent as a result of new automobile user groups as well as lower generalized costs of car travel.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAVs will likely be safer than human-driven cars, in large part through reducing human error which the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) estimates accounts for 94 percent of crashes. While widespread adoption of AVs should ultimately result in safer roads, there have been several high profile accidents involving AVs, such as a Waymo van that crashed into a car in Arizona. Perhaps as a result of some of these high-profile accidents, consumer demand for AVs seems to be relatively low. According to a 2021 survey by the American Automobile Association, only 14 percent of drivers report that they would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself, a response similar to the 2020 survey. It is possible, however, that consumer attitudes will change once Level 4 and 5 vehicles become commercially available.\\r\\nf\\r\\nAVs may help to reduce labor input costs in driving-intensive industries. However, as Gittleman and Monaco (2017) point out, there are several types of drivers, and autonomous driving will likely affect some types more than others.[4]  Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be used for heavy and tractor trailer truck purposes (aka \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u0153long haul\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u009d) than local delivery given the relative ease of navigating on highways and all the other tasks associated with local delivery, including freight handling, paperwork, and customer service. Gittleman and Monaco estimate that Level 4 and 5 automation may ultimately displace 300,000 to 400,000 drivers. But the authors highlight that there are many practical limitations to automation. For example, they highlight that one of the important functions of a truck driver is to serve as a security guard for the freight.\\r\\n\\r\\nA recent paper by Gelauff, Ossokina, and Teulings (2019) envisions some of the longer-term outcomes from AVs.[5]  The authors model two countervailing effects from AVs, each of which lead to differing outcomes on population distribution. On one hand, AVs may lead to improved use of time during car trips, which lowers the cost of living at a distance from cities. On the other hand, AVs may lead to improved public transit options in urban environments in the form of shared-ride autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The authors argue that SAVs may be more efficient than existing public transit and may make city living relatively more attractive leading to more population clustering in cities. The authors argue that the second effect may outweigh the first and ultimately may lead to overall population shifts towards large, attractive cities at the expense of smaller urban and non-urban areas. While the authors don\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122t speculate on the ultimate economic effects of such a change, it is worth noting that literature from economic geography suggests that there are many agglomeration effects from living in or close to cities, including greater economic growth and innovation.[6]  It is also worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a large shift in population away from many urban environments, at least in the short run.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, AVs will likely affect our economy and society in a variety of ways. AVs may lead to fewer emissions and increased safety. By decreasing the need for humans to drive, AVs will likely transform the type of work done by humans in the transportation sector of the economy and may also change the way that humans commute to and from work. How all this plays out, however, depends on numerous factors including, importantly, existing and future regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nCURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE AV LEGISLATION\\r\\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures highlights that a number of states have introduced and enacted laws related to autonomous vehicles. Notably, in December 2020, California State Senator Ben Allen introduced a bill to establish a new Council on the Future of Transportation in California that would promote state legislation for autonomous vehicles, in addition to other transportation-related policy. Also, in November 2020 the California Public Utilities Commission approved autonomous vehicle regulatory framework that would make it easier for companies to provide autonomous vehicle transportation services to the public. While these laws indicate that state legislators are responsive to local concerns about autonomous vehicles, the risk is a resulting patchwork of state laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this concern in mind, there have been attempts at federal legislation, notably in 2017 with the SELF DRIVE Act in the House and the AV START Act in the Senate. The SELF DRIVE Act (Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act) was passed in the House in 2017 but did not advance in the Senate. The bill would have provided NHTSA with the authority to regulate AVs. NHTSA would be authorized to require safety assessment certifications and states would be preempted from enacting laws regarding the design, construction, or performance of AVs unless those laws enact standards identical to federal standards. In addition, the bill would have required that manufacturers of AVs develop written cybersecurity and privacy plans for such vehicles prior to offering them for sale. The AV START Act (American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies Act) was introduced in the Senate in 2017 but did not advance. Like the SELF DRIVE Act, it would have established a framework for a federal role in oversight of AVs, preempting state laws and providing clarity to stakeholders including car manufacturers and insurance companies.\", \"Category\": \"Suziki\", \"Complete_Filename\": \"Neha_Assign_AutonomusCar2.txt-Suziki\"}]}}, {\"mode\": \"vega-lite\"});\n",

       "'A year ago, Detroit and Silicon Valley had visions of putting thousands of self-driving taxis on the road in 2019, ushering in an age of driverless cars.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of those cars have yet to arrive â€” and it is likely to be years before they do. Several carmakers and technology companies have concluded that making autonomous vehicles is going to be harder, slower and costlier than they thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œWe overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles,â€\\x9d Fordâ€™s chief executive, Jim Hackett, said at the Detroit Economic Club in April.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the most recent sign of the scramble to regroup, Ford and Volkswagen said Friday that they were teaming up to tackle the self-driving challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two automakers plan to use autonomous-vehicle technology from a Pittsburgh start-up, Argo AI, in ride-sharing services in a few urban zones as early as 2021. But Argoâ€™s chief executive, Bryan Salesky, said the industryâ€™s bigger promise of creating driverless cars that could go anywhere was â€œway in the future.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe and others attribute the delay to something as obvious as it is stubborn: human behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers at Argo say the cars they are testing in Pittsburgh and Miami have to navigate unexpected situations every day. Recently, one of the companyâ€™s cars encountered a bicyclist riding the wrong way down a busy street between other vehicles. Another Argo test car came across a street sweeper that suddenly turned a giant circle in an intersection, touching all four corners and crossing lanes of traffic that had the green light.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œYou see all kinds of crazy things on the road, and it turns out theyâ€™re not all that infrequent, but you have to be able to handle all of them,â€\\x9d Mr. Salesky said. â€œWith radar and high-resolution cameras and all the computing power we have, we can detect and identify the objects on a street. The hard part is anticipating what theyâ€™re going to do next.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Salesky said Argo and many competitors had developed about 80 percent of the technology needed to put self-driving cars into routine use â€” the radar, cameras and other sensors that can identify objects far down roads and highways. But the remaining 20 percent, including developing software that can reliably anticipate what other drivers, pedestrians and cyclists are going to do, will be much more difficult, he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nA year ago, many industry executives exuded much greater certainty. They thought that their engineers had solved the most vexing technical problems and promised that self-driving cars would be shuttling people around town in at least several cities by sometime this year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaymo, which is owned by Googleâ€™s parent company, Alphabet, announced that it would buy up to 62,000 Chrysler minivans and 20,000 Jaguar electric cars for its ride service, which operates in the Phoenix suburbs. General Motors announced that it would also start a taxi service by the end of this year with vehicles, developed by its Cruise division, that have no steering wheels or pedals.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptivated by the notion of disrupting the transportation system, deep-pocketed investors rushed to get a piece of the action. Honda and the Japanese tech giant SoftBank invested in Cruise. Amazon, which hopes to deliver goods to its shoppers by driverless vehicles, invested in Aurora, another start-up in this area.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œThere was this incredible optimism,â€\\x9d said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Navigant Research. â€œCompanies thought this was a very straightforward problem. You just throw in some sensors and artificial intelligence, and it would be easy to do.â€\\x9dnd artificial intelligence, and it would be easy to do.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe industryâ€™s unbridled confidence was quickly dented when a self-driving car being tested by Uber hit and killed a woman walking a bicycle across a street last year in Tempe, Ariz. A safety driver was at the wheel of the vehicle, but was watching a TV show on her phone just before the crash, according to the Tempe Police Department.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince that fatality, â€œalmost everybody has reset their expectations,â€\\x9d Mr. Abuelsamid said. It was believed to be the first pedestrian death involving a self-driving vehicle. Elsewhere in the United States, three Tesla drivers have died in crashes that occurred while the companyâ€™s Autopilot driver-assistance system was engaged and both it and the drivers failed to detect and react to hazards.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompanies like Waymo and G.M. now say they still expect to roll out thousands of self-driving cars â€” but they are much more reluctant to say when that will happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaymo operates a fleet of 600 test vehicles â€” the same number it had on the road a year ago. A portion of them are the first set of vehicles it will be buying through the agreements with Chrysler and Jaguar. The company said it expected to increase purchases as it expanded its ride service.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œWe are able to do the driving task,â€\\x9d Tekedra Mawakana, Waymoâ€™s chief external officer, said in an interview. â€œBut the reason we donâ€™t have a service in 50 states is that we are still validating a host of elements related to offering a service. Offering a service is very different than building a technology.â€\\x9d\\r\\n\\r\\nG.M. declined to say if it was still on track to start a ride service â€œat scaleâ€\\x9d this year, as it originally planned. Its chief executive, Mary Barra, told analysts in June that Cruise was moving â€œat a very aggressive paceâ€\\x9d without saying when commercial operations would begin.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina, which has the worldâ€™s largest auto market and is investing heavily in electric vehicles, is trailing in development of self-driving cars, analysts say. The country allows automakers to test such cars on public roads in only a handful of cities. One leading Chinese company working on autonomous technology, Baidu, is doing much of its research at a lab in Silicon Valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla and its chief executive, Elon Musk, are nearly alone in predicting widespread use of self-driving cars within the next year. In April, Mr. Musk said Tesla would have as many as a million autonomous â€œrobo taxisâ€\\x9d by the end of 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nTesla believes its new self-driving system, based on a computer chip it designed, and the data it gathers from Tesla cars now on the road will enable the company to start offering fully autonomous driving next year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut many experts are very skeptical that Tesla can pull that off.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Salesky said it was relatively easy to enable a car to see and identify obstacles on the road with the help of radar, cameras and lidar â€” a kind of radar that uses lasers â€” as well as the software and computing power to process images and data.\\r\\n\\r\\nItâ€™s much more difficult to prepare self-driving cars for unusual circumstances â€” pedestrians crossing the road when cars have the green light, cars making illegal turns. Researchers call these â€œcorner cases,â€\\x9d although in city traffic they occur often.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œIf youâ€™re out driving 20 hours a day, you have a lot of opportunities to see these things,â€\\x9d Mr. Salesky said.\\r\\n\\r\\nEqually challenging is teaching self-driving cars the finer points of driving, sometimes known as â€œmicro maneuvers.â€\\x9d If a vehicle ahead is moving slowly looking for a parking space, it is best to not follow too closely so the car has room to back into an open spot. Or to know that if a car is edging out into an intersection, it can be a sign the driver may dart out even if he doesnâ€™t have the right of way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe technology is available now to create a car that wonâ€™t hit anything. But such a car would constantly slam on the brakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œIf the car is overly cautious, this becomes a nuisance,â€\\x9d said Huei Peng, director of Mcity, an autonomous-vehicle research center at the University of Michigan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome companies argue that the way to get more self-driving vehicles on the road is by using them in controlled settings and situations. May Mobility operates autonomous shuttles in Detroit; Providence, R.I.; and Columbus, Ohio. These are not minivans or full-size cars but six-passenger golf carts. They travel short, defined routes at no more than 25 miles per hour. In many cases they provide public transportation where none is available.\\r\\n\\r\\nâ€œA vehicle that needs to go at higher speeds will need more expensive, more exotic sensors,â€\\x9d said Alisyn Malek, the companyâ€™s chief operating officer. â€œUsing a low-speed vehicle makes the task of operating an autonomous vehicle easier, so we can use what works in the technology today.â€\\x9d'"
